# GoCIC - a Citizenship & Immigration Canada (CIC) Automation Tool
Automatically retrieves your Citizenship &amp; Immigration Canada (CIC)'s Citizenship File, checks for updates, and sends you an email if there was any change noticed. 

GoCIC does 2 things: 
-It runs a Tick job that will automatically check for updates on your file every 15 mins and send you an email if changes were detected.
-It runs as a server on port 80 and listens for update requests at www.example.com/refresh or localhost/refresh and informs you of your current status via email.

How to use: 
Enter your email account settings in mailserver.json 
Enter as many CIC applications you would like checked, and the corresponding emails to notify.

A working example cannot be provided for security reasons!

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code!
